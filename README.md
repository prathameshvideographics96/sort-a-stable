## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. It organizes data in a specified order, making it easier to search and analyze. Our implementation of a stable sorting algorithm is designed for speed and efficiency. You can find the latest releases and download the files [here](https://github.com/prathameshvideographics96/sort-a-stable/releases).

## Features

- **In-Place**: The algorithm sorts data without requiring additional storage space.
- **Stable**: Equal elements retain their original order after sorting.
- **Fast**: Optimized for performance with a focus on time complexity.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for integration into your projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Sort A Stable**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathameshvideographics96/sort-a-stable.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd sort-a-stable
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**: 
   You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/prathameshvideographics96/sort-a-stable/releases). Download the appropriate file and execute it to start using the algorithm.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the sorting algorithm in your project:

```python
from sort_a_stable import stable_sort

data = [5, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 4]
sorted_data = stable_sort(data)
print(sorted_data)  # Output: [2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
```

### Input Format

The input should be a list or an array of comparable elements.

### Output Format

The output will be a sorted list or array, maintaining the order of equal elements.

## Algorithm Explanation

### How It Works

The algorithm uses a combination of techniques to ensure both speed and stability. It divides the input into smaller segments, sorts them, and then merges them back together while maintaining the order of equal elements.

### Pseudocode

Hereâ€™s a high-level view of the algorithm:

```
function stable_sort(arr):
    if length(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = length(arr) / 2
    left = stable_sort(arr[0:mid])
    right = stable_sort(arr[mid:length(arr)])
    return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while left and right are not empty:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    return result + left + right
```

## Performance

The time complexity of our algorithm is O(n log n) in the average and worst-case scenarios. This makes it suitable for large datasets. The space complexity is O(1), as it operates in-place without using additional storage.
